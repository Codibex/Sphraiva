# Austrian Apple Strudel Recipe (Apfelstrudel)

This classic Austrian dessert features a **delicate, flaky pastry** wrapped around a warm, spiced apple filling. It's a delightful treat, perfect with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough

* 250g (2 cups) **all-purpose flour**
* 1 pinch of **salt**
* 1 **egg**
* 1 tbsp **vegetable oil** (or melted butter)
* 125ml (1/2 cup) **lukewarm water**

### For the Filling

* 1.2 kg (approx. 6-7 medium) **tart apples** (e.g., Granny Smith, Boskoop), peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
* 100g (1/2 cup) **granulated sugar** (adjust to apple sweetness)
* 1 tsp **ground cinnamon**
* 1/2 tsp **ground cloves** (optional)
* Juice of 1/2 **lemon**
* 80g (1/2 cup) **raisins** (optional, soaked in rum for extra flavor)
* 50g (1/2 cup) **breadcrumbs**
* 50g (3.5 tbsp) **butter**, melted

### For Brushing and Topping:

* 50g (3.5 tbsp) **melted butter**
* **Powdered sugar** for dusting

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Dough

* In a large bowl, combine the **flour** and **salt**.
* In a separate small bowl, whisk together the **egg**, **vegetable oil**, and **lukewarm water**.
* Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.
* Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and **knead for at least 10-15 minutes** until it's smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. This is crucial for a pliable dough.
* Form the dough into a ball, brush lightly with oil, cover with a warm bowl, and let it **rest for at least 30 minutes** (or up to 1 hour) at room temperature. This allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to stretch.

### 2. Prepare the Filling

* In a large bowl, combine the **sliced apples** with **sugar**, **cinnamon**, **cloves** (if using), and **lemon juice**. Mix well and set aside.
* In a small pan, melt **50g butter** (for the filling). Add the **breadcrumbs** and toast them over medium heat until golden brown and fragrant. This adds texture and absorbs excess moisture.

### 3. Stretch the Dough

* Lightly flour a large clean **tablecloth or a clean bed sheet**. This will help you stretch the dough thinly and roll it.
* Place the rested dough in the center and flatten it slightly with your hands.
* Using a rolling pin, carefully roll the dough into a thin rectangle.
* Now, the challenging but fun part: gently **stretch the dough with your hands**. Start from the center and work outwards, placing your hands under the dough. Try to stretch it until it's **paper-thin** and almost transparent, large enough to cover the entire tablecloth. You should be able to read a newspaper through it! If it tears a little, don't worry too much; you can patch it up.

### 4. Assemble the Strudel

* Preheat your oven to **180°C (350°F)**.
* Brush the stretched dough with about **30g of the melted butter** (from the filling butter).
* Sprinkle the **toasted breadcrumbs** evenly over two-thirds of the dough, leaving about a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) border along the shorter sides and one long side.
* Evenly distribute the **apple filling** over the breadcrumbs. If using, scatter the **raisins** over the apples.
* Fold the borderless long side of the dough over the filling. Then, fold in the two shorter sides.
* Using the tablecloth, carefully **roll the strudel up tightly** from the filled long side.
* Carefully transfer the rolled strudel to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, seam-side down. You might need to gently lift it with both hands or use two spatulas.

### 5. Bake the Strudel

* Brush the top of the strudel generously with the remaining **melted butter** (from the "for brushing" portion).
* Bake for **40-50 minutes**, or until the strudel is golden brown and crispy.

### 6. Serve

* Let the strudel cool slightly on a wire rack before slicing.
* Dust generously with **powdered sugar** before serving.
* Enjoy warm with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or a warm vanilla sauce.
